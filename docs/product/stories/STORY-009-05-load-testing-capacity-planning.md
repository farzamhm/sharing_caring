# Story 009.05: Load Testing & Capacity Planning

**Epic:** EPIC-009 - Platform Scalability & Performance
**Priority:** Medium
**Story Points:** 7
**Sprint:** TBD

## User Story
**As a** platform operator  
**I want** regular load testing and capacity planning  
**So that** the platform can handle growth and peak usage without degradation  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated load testing scenarios for daily peak, viral growth, and sustained growth patterns
- [ ] Virtual user simulation with realistic behavior patterns (browsing, posting, claiming)
- [ ] Performance validation against target metrics (response time, throughput, error rates)
- [ ] Capacity recommendation generation based on test results and growth projections
- [ ] Bottleneck identification and performance optimization recommendations
- [ ] Load testing automation with scheduled execution and reporting
- [ ] Disaster recovery and failover scenario testing
- [ ] Economic impact analysis for capacity planning decisions

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Load testing framework deployed and validated
- [ ] Test scenarios executed successfully
- [ ] Capacity planning recommendations generated
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks identified and documented

## Technical Notes
- Automated load testing framework with realistic user behavior simulation
- Performance metrics collection and analysis during load tests
- Capacity modeling and recommendation engine based on test results
- Integration with monitoring systems for real-time performance tracking
- Bottleneck analysis using profiling and performance measurement tools
- Economic modeling for cost-effective capacity planning decisions

## Dependencies
- Load testing tools and infrastructure
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection systems
- Test environment provisioning and management
- Virtual user behavior modeling and simulation
- Capacity planning and forecasting tools
- Economic analysis and cost optimization systems

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Load testing impacting production system performance
- **Mitigation**: Isolated test environments and careful test scheduling
- **Risk**: Unrealistic load testing scenarios providing misleading capacity recommendations
- **Mitigation**: Realistic user behavior modeling and validation against production patterns

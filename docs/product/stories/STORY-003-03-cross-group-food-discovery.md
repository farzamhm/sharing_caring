# Story 003.03: Cross-Group Food Discovery

**Epic:** EPIC-003 - Inter-Group Partnership Network
**Priority:** High
**Story Points:** 6
**Sprint:** TBD

## User Story
**As a** group member in a partnered group  
**I want to** browse and claim food from partner groups  
**So that** I can access more food sharing opportunities  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Food posts from partner groups visible in discovery
- [ ] Clear visual distinction between own group and partner group posts
- [ ] Pseudonymous usernames maintained for privacy
- [ ] Pickup coordination through bot messaging system
- [ ] Partnership terms enforced (distance limits, food types)
- [ ] Member claim limits respected based on partnership agreement
- [ ] Cross-group activity tracking and analytics
- [ ] Seamless user experience across group boundaries

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] UX/UI reviewed and approved
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Security review completed (if applicable)

## Technical Notes
- Discovery Flow:
  ```
  Member browses food → Shows:
  • Own group posts (always visible)
  • Partner group posts (clearly marked)
  • Pseudonymous usernames for privacy
  • Pickup coordination through bot
  ```
- Cross-Group Display:
  - Group indicator: "From [Partner Group Name]"
  - Distance information based on partnership terms
  - Pseudonymous sharer identification
  - Partnership-specific food type filtering
- Claim Validation:
  - Check member's remaining claims for partnership
  - Verify reputation requirements
  - Enforce distance and food type restrictions
- Activity tracking in `partnership_activities` table

## Dependencies
- Partnership terms enforcement engine
- Cross-group privacy protection system
- Food discovery and filtering infrastructure
- Bot coordination system for cross-group pickup

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Privacy breaches in cross-group interactions
- **Mitigation**: Pseudonym system and data minimization
- **Risk**: Partnership terms violations
- **Mitigation**: Automated validation and monitoring

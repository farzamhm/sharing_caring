## Technical Notes
- Partnership State Machine:
  ```
  PENDING → ACTIVE ← SUSPENDED
     ↓         ↓        ↓
  DECLINED  TERMINATED TERMINATED
  ```
- Management Actions:
  - **Modify Terms**: Update partnership conditions with approval workflow
  - **Temporary Suspension**: Pause partnership with reason and duration
  - **Permanent Termination**: End partnership with notice period
  - **Renewal Management**: Handle automatic renewals based on terms
- State Transitions:
  - All changes logged in audit trail
  - Notifications sent to both group admins
  - Cross-group activity immediately affected by state changes
- Data Handling:
  - Active partnerships: full functionality
  - Suspended partnerships: restricted functionality with notice
  - Terminated partnerships: historical data retained, no new activity

## Dependencies
- Partnership state management system
- Admin notification infrastructure
- Audit logging framework
- Cross-group activity control system

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Disputed partnership modifications
- **Mitigation**: Clear approval workflows and dispute resolution process
- **Risk**: Data inconsistency during state transitions
- **Mitigation**: Atomic state changes and validation checks

# Story 001.05: Existing User Migration

**Epic:** EPIC-001 - Dual-Mode Platform Foundation
**Priority:** Critical
**Story Points:** 6
**Sprint:** TBD

## User Story
**As an** existing neighborhood mode user  
**I want** my account and data preserved during the dual-mode implementation  
**So that** I can continue using the platform without disruption  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All existing users automatically assigned to Neighborhood Mode
- [ ] Existing verification data preserved and mapped to new system
- [ ] User profiles, reputation, and credits maintained
- [ ] Food sharing history preserved
- [ ] No downtime during migration process
- [ ] Migration rollback plan available
- [ ] Users notified of new dual-mode features post-migration

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] UX/UI reviewed and approved
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Security review completed (if applicable)

## Technical Notes
- Database migration scripts for mode assignment
- Data integrity verification during migration
- `sharing_mode` field defaulted to 'neighborhood' for existing users
- `verification_level` field populated based on existing verification data
- Migration events published to audit streams
- Rollback procedures documented and tested

## Dependencies
- Database migration tooling
- Data backup and recovery systems
- Migration testing environment
- Communication plan for users

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Data loss during migration
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive backups, testing, and rollback procedures
- **Risk**: User confusion about changes
- **Mitigation**: Clear communication and gradual feature introduction
- **Risk**: Performance impact during migration
- **Mitigation**: Off-peak migration scheduling and performance monitoring

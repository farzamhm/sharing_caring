## ü§ñ CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI DEVELOPERS

### **BEFORE STARTING ANY STORY:**

1. **READ ALL REFERENCES:**
   - Epic document for the story's epic
   - Architecture specs from Winston  
   - Database schemas from epic technical notes
   - Valkey streams configuration

2. **NEVER SKIP DEPENDENCIES:**
   - Check "Dependencies" section in each story
   - Verify all blocking stories are 100% complete
   - Confirm database schema changes are deployed

3. **FOLLOW EXACT SPECIFICATIONS:**
   - Use exact database table/column names from epics
   - Follow Valkey stream naming conventions  
   - Implement precise API endpoints as specified

### **IMPLEMENTATION CHECKPOINTS:**

**Before Coding:**
- [ ] All dependencies verified complete
- [ ] Database schema changes deployed  
- [ ] Valkey streams configured correctly
- [ ] Test environment has all prerequisites

**During Implementation:**
- [ ] Follow exact technical specifications from epic docs
- [ ] Use consistent naming conventions across codebase
- [ ] Implement ALL acceptance criteria (no shortcuts)
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling

**Before Marking Complete:**
- [ ] All acceptance criteria demonstrably met
- [ ] Unit tests passing (80%+ coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing features
- [ ] Performance meets sub-2-second requirements

### **CRITICAL ERROR PREVENTION:**

‚ùå **DO NOT:**
- Start a story without completing its dependencies
- Skip any acceptance criteria items
- Make assumptions about implementation details
- Use different naming than specified in epics
- Modify existing database schema without migration scripts

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Read the full epic document before starting
- Follow Winston's architecture specifications exactly  
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add detailed logging for debugging
- Test with real Telegram bot integration

### **EMERGENCY CONTACTS:**

- **Architecture Questions:** Consult Winston's architecture documents
- **Requirements Clarification:** Reference specific epic documents
- **Process Issues:** Bob (Scrum Master) - that's me!
- **Story Acceptance:** Sarah (Product Owner)

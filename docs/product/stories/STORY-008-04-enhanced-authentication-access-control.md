# Story 008.04: Enhanced Authentication & Access Control

**Epic:** EPIC-008 - Security & Privacy Enhancements
**Priority:** High
**Story Points:** 6
**Sprint:** TBD

## User Story
**As a** security-conscious user  
**I want** multiple authentication options and session management  
**So that** my account remains secure even if one authentication method is compromised  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication options (SMS, TOTP, email, biometric)
- [ ] MFA setup and verification workflow with clear instructions
- [ ] Secure session management with appropriate timeouts and refresh tokens
- [ ] Session monitoring and management interface showing active sessions
- [ ] Device and location-based access controls with suspicious activity detection
- [ ] Account recovery options with secure verification methods
- [ ] Authentication audit log for security monitoring
- [ ] Integration with existing authentication systems and user workflow

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review and penetration testing completed
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication methods tested
- [ ] Session management security verified
- [ ] Account recovery process security validated

## Technical Notes
- Multi-factor authentication system with multiple method support
- Secure session management with JWT tokens and refresh mechanisms
- Device and location tracking for suspicious activity detection
- Account recovery system with secure verification and audit trails
- Authentication audit logging for security monitoring and compliance
- Integration with existing user authentication and authorization systems

## Dependencies
- Authentication infrastructure and token management systems
- SMS and email delivery systems for MFA
- Biometric authentication capabilities for mobile applications
- Session management and token validation systems
- Security monitoring and audit logging infrastructure
- Account recovery and verification systems

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Authentication system complexity reducing user experience
- **Mitigation**: Progressive security enhancement with optional advanced features
- **Risk**: MFA implementation vulnerabilities compromising security
- **Mitigation**: Security reviews, penetration testing, and industry best practices

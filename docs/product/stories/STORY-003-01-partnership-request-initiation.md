## Technical Notes

  1. Group Search: Search by name, location, activity level
  2. Group Preview: Member count, activity metrics, admin info
  3. Partnership Type: Bidirectional/Unidirectional selection
  4. Terms Configuration: Distance, food types, trial period
  5. Custom Message: Personal note to target admin
- Terms Structure in JSONB:
  ```json
  {
    "food_types_shared": ["meals", "snacks", "ingredients"],
    "max_distance_km": 10,
    "pickup_coordination": "direct_contact",
    "trial_period_days": 30,
    "auto_renewal": true,
    "member_limits": {
      "max_claims_per_member": 3,
      "reputation_requirement": 70
    }
  }
  ```
- Stored in `group_partnerships` table with status 'pending'

# Story 002.03: Pseudonym Generation & Privacy

**Epic:** EPIC-002 - Community Group Management System
**Priority:** High
**Story Points:** 4
**Sprint:** TBD

## User Story
**As a** group member  
**I want** an automatically generated pseudonym  
**So that** my real identity is protected while participating in food sharing  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unique pseudonym generated per user-group combination
- [ ] Pseudonyms are consistent across sessions
- [ ] No reverse engineering possible from pseudonym
- [ ] Pseudonym uniqueness enforced within each group
- [ ] Algorithm generates readable but anonymous names
- [ ] Collision detection and handling implemented
- [ ] Privacy protection verified through security audit

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] UX/UI reviewed and approved
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Security review completed (if applicable)

## Technical Notes
- Pseudonym Algorithm:
  ```python
  def generate_group_pseudonym(username: str, group_name: str) -> str:
      user_prefix = username[:3].lower()
      group_prefix = group_name.replace(" ", "")[:3].lower()
      
      # Generate deterministic but private suffix
      hash_input = f"{username}-{group_name}-{SECRET_SALT}"
      hash_suffix = hashlib.md5(hash_input.encode()).hexdigest()[:4]
      
      return f"{user_prefix}{group_prefix}{hash_suffix}"
  ```
- Example: "john_doe" + "Office Foodies" â†’ "johoff3a2b"
- Stored in `pseudonym` field in `group_member_status` table
- Unique constraint on (group_id, pseudonym)

## Dependencies
- Secure salt generation and storage
- Database schema for pseudonym storage
- Privacy audit framework
- Collision detection system

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Pseudonym collisions
- **Mitigation**: Robust hashing algorithm and collision detection
- **Risk**: Privacy compromise through reverse engineering
- **Mitigation**: Strong hash function and security audit

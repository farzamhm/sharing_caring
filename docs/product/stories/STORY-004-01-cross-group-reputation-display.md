# Story 004.01: Cross-Group Reputation Display

**Epic:** EPIC-004 - Global Reputation System
**Priority:** Critical
**Story Points:** 8
**Sprint:** TBD

## User Story
**As a** group member  
**I want to** see the global reputation of other members when they post or claim food  
**So that** I can make informed decisions about food sharing interactions  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Reputation information displayed alongside food posts (score, trust level, badge)
- [ ] Reputation details include successful exchanges, average rating, and reliability
- [ ] Display shows cross-group activity summary (e.g., "152 successful exchanges across 3 groups")
- [ ] Trust level badge prominently displayed with appropriate color coding
- [ ] Reputation visibility respects user privacy settings
- [ ] Information loads quickly without impacting page performance
- [ ] Mobile-optimized display for reputation information
- [ ] Reputation data refreshes in real-time when changes occur

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] UX/UI reviewed and approved
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Performance testing completed
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified

## Technical Notes
- Reputation data cached to prevent database performance issues
- Event-driven updates via Valkey streams when reputation changes
- Privacy filters applied based on user settings before display
- Responsive design for different screen sizes and platforms
- Integration with existing food post display components
- Real-time updates using WebSocket connections where appropriate

## Dependencies
- Global reputation calculation engine (from core reputation system)
- Privacy control system for reputation visibility settings
- Cross-group data access permissions
- Food post display component updates
- Caching infrastructure for reputation data

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Performance impact of loading reputation data for all users
- **Mitigation**: Implement efficient caching and lazy loading strategies
- **Risk**: Privacy concerns with cross-group reputation visibility
- **Mitigation**: Granular privacy controls and user education about reputation sharing

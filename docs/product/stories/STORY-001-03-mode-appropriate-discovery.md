# Story 001.03: Mode-Appropriate Discovery

**Epic:** EPIC-001 - Dual-Mode Platform Foundation
**Priority:** High
**Story Points:** 6
**Sprint:** TBD

## User Story
**As a** user in either mode  
**I want** to browse food shared within my community scope  
**So that** I can access relevant food sharing opportunities  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Neighborhood Mode shows food from same building + nearby verified buildings
- [ ] Community Mode shows food from joined Telegram groups only
- [ ] Clear visual distinction between mode-specific content
- [ ] No cross-mode contamination (neighborhood users don't see community posts)
- [ ] Discovery performance maintained across both modes
- [ ] Search and filtering work appropriately for each mode
- [ ] Food post metadata includes mode context

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] UX/UI reviewed and approved
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Security review completed (if applicable)

## Technical Notes
- Discovery Logic Implementation:
  - **Neighborhood Mode**: Building-based geographic filtering
  - **Community Mode**: Telegram group membership filtering
- Events published to `group.mode.activities` Valkey stream
- Database queries optimized for mode-specific discovery
- Caching strategy for improved performance

## Dependencies
- Geographic data for neighborhood discovery
- Telegram group membership tracking
- Food post categorization system
- Search and filtering infrastructure

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Performance degradation with complex filtering
- **Mitigation**: Database indexing optimization and caching implementation
- **Risk**: Discovery algorithm complexity
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and gradual rollout

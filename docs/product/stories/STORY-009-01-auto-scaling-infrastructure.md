# Story 009.01: Auto-Scaling Infrastructure

**Epic:** EPIC-009 - Platform Scalability & Performance
**Priority:** Medium
**Story Points:** 8
**Sprint:** TBD

## User Story
**As a** platform operator  
**I want** infrastructure that automatically scales based on demand  
**So that** users always have fast, reliable access regardless of load spikes  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Auto-scaling policies for bot instances, API servers, and database read replicas
- [ ] Multiple scaling metrics including CPU, memory, response time, connections, and queue depth
- [ ] Configurable scaling thresholds with scale-out and scale-in cooldown periods
- [ ] Health check integration for scaling decision validation
- [ ] Economic optimization to balance performance with cost efficiency
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting for scaling events and system capacity
- [ ] Manual override capabilities for planned events or emergency situations
- [ ] Performance validation across different load scenarios

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Auto-scaling policies tested under various load conditions
- [ ] Cost optimization validated
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting system implemented
- [ ] Manual override functionality verified

## Technical Notes
- Container orchestration system (Kubernetes) with horizontal pod autoscaling
- Multi-metric scaling decisions using CPU, memory, and custom application metrics
- Predictive scaling based on historical patterns and scheduled events
- Cost optimization algorithms to minimize infrastructure costs while maintaining performance
- Integration with monitoring systems for real-time metric collection
- Circuit breaker patterns for graceful degradation during scaling events

## Dependencies
- Container orchestration infrastructure (Kubernetes)
- Monitoring and metrics collection systems
- Load balancer and traffic management systems
- Database clustering and read replica management
- Cost monitoring and optimization tools
- Infrastructure automation and deployment systems

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Auto-scaling causing service instability during rapid scaling events
- **Mitigation**: Gradual scaling with health checks and manual override capabilities
- **Risk**: Cost escalation from aggressive scaling policies
- **Mitigation**: Economic monitoring, scaling limits, and cost optimization algorithms

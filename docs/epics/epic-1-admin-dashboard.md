# Epic 1: Admin Dashboard - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal
Add a basic web-based admin dashboard to monitor system health, view user activity metrics, and manage reported issues, enabling operational oversight without requiring direct database access.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: Complete architecture with Elasticsearch logging, business metrics collection, and health monitoring endpoints
- Technology stack: FastAPI backend with Elasticsearch/Kibana for analytics, Prometheus metrics
- Integration points: Existing health check endpoints, Elasticsearch business metrics, user/food post APIs

**Enhancement Details:**
- **What's being added:** Web-based admin dashboard with authentication, system health overview, user activity metrics, and basic issue management
- **How it integrates:** New FastAPI routes serving a simple web interface, consuming existing health endpoints and Elasticsearch data
- **Success criteria:** Admin can monitor system health, view key business metrics, and manage user reports without database access

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Admin Authentication & Basic Dashboard Shell
   - Implement admin login with session management
   - Create basic dashboard layout with navigation
   - Add system health status display using existing /health endpoint

2. **Story 2:** Business Metrics Visualization
   - Display key metrics from Elasticsearch (daily active users, food exchanges, success rates)
   - Add simple charts/graphs for trend visualization
   - Implement refresh functionality for real-time updates

3. **Story 3:** User Report Management Interface  
   - Create interface to view and manage user-submitted reports
   - Add ability to mark reports as resolved
   - Implement basic user lookup for support context

## Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ Existing APIs remain unchanged (only consuming existing endpoints)
- ✅ Database schema changes are backward compatible (no schema changes required)
- ✅ UI changes follow existing patterns (new standalone admin interface)
- ✅ Performance impact is minimal (read-only operations on existing data)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Admin access could expose sensitive user data
- **Mitigation:** Role-based access control, audit logging of admin actions, minimal PII exposure
- **Rollback Plan:** Remove admin routes and static files, no data migration needed

## Definition of Done

- ✅ All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Existing functionality verified through testing (no changes to core bot/API)
- ✅ Integration points working correctly (health endpoints, Elasticsearch queries)
- ✅ Documentation updated appropriately (admin setup instructions)
- ✅ No regression in existing features (isolated admin functionality)

## Story Manager Handoff

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running **Python 3.11+/FastAPI with Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, Redis**
- Integration points: **/health endpoint, Elasticsearch business metrics indices, existing user/report APIs**
- Existing patterns to follow: **FastAPI route structure, async/await patterns, Elasticsearch queries, JWT authentication**
- Critical compatibility requirements: **No changes to existing bot functionality, read-only data access, secure admin authentication, audit logging**
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering **operational visibility and basic admin capabilities for the Neighborhood Sharing Platform**."

## Epic Summary

This brownfield epic adds essential operational capabilities to the Neighborhood Sharing Platform through a focused 3-story implementation:

1. **Immediate Value:** Provides operational oversight without requiring direct system access
2. **Low Risk:** Read-only integration with existing data sources  
3. **Manageable Scope:** Leverages existing architecture and patterns
4. **Strategic Foundation:** Sets up admin capabilities for future operational enhancements

The epic respects the existing system's bot-first architecture while adding crucial administrative functionality for platform management and support operations.

# Story 006.06: Automated Monitoring & Alerts

**Epic:** EPIC-006 - Advanced Admin & Moderation Tools
**Priority:** High
**Story Points:** 7
**Sprint:** TBD

## User Story
**As a** platform administrator  
**I want** automated systems to detect and alert about potential issues  
**So that** problems can be addressed before they impact user experience  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Monitoring rules for reputation manipulation, spam behavior, safety concerns, economic anomalies
- [ ] Configurable alert thresholds and severity levels (low, medium, high, critical)
- [ ] Automated response actions for certain alert types (rate limiting, content review)
- [ ] Alert routing to appropriate administrators based on issue type and severity
- [ ] Alert aggregation to prevent notification spam
- [ ] Historical alert analysis for pattern recognition and trend identification
- [ ] Integration with incident response workflows
- [ ] False positive detection and alert tuning capabilities

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Monitoring rules engine implemented
- [ ] Alert routing and notification system completed
- [ ] Automated response actions tested
- [ ] Alert tuning and management interface completed

## Technical Notes
- Real-time monitoring system with configurable rules and thresholds
- Event-driven alert generation based on platform activity patterns
- Automated response system for immediate issue mitigation
- Alert aggregation and deduplication to prevent notification overload
- Machine learning integration for pattern recognition and anomaly detection
- Integration with incident response and escalation workflows

## Dependencies
- Real-time data streaming and processing infrastructure
- Pattern recognition and anomaly detection systems
- Notification and communication systems
- Automated response and mitigation tools
- Incident response and case management systems
- Machine learning infrastructure for advanced detection

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: False positive alerts overwhelming administrators
- **Mitigation**: Alert tuning capabilities, machine learning improvement, and intelligent aggregation
- **Risk**: Critical issues missed due to monitoring system failures
- **Mitigation**: Redundant monitoring systems and regular system health checks

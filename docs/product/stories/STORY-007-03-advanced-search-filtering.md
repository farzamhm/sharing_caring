# Story 007.03: Advanced Search & Filtering

**Epic:** EPIC-007 - Enhanced User Experience & Features
**Priority:** Medium
**Story Points:** 7
**Sprint:** TBD

## User Story
**As a** user looking for specific food  
**I want** sophisticated search and filtering capabilities  
**So that** I can quickly find exactly what I'm looking for  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-dimensional filtering: cuisine type, meal type, dietary restrictions, allergens
- [ ] Geographic filtering with distance range and location type options
- [ ] Time-based filtering for pickup availability and scheduling
- [ ] Social filtering by sharer reputation and previous interactions
- [ ] Advanced search with natural language processing and semantic understanding
- [ ] Saved searches with notification alerts for matching new food
- [ ] Search result ranking based on relevance, distance, and user preferences
- [ ] Search performance optimized for complex filter combinations

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Search performance benchmarked and optimized
- [ ] Filter combination accuracy validated
- [ ] Saved search and alert system tested
- [ ] Natural language search processing verified

## Technical Notes
- Advanced search engine with multi-dimensional indexing
- Natural language processing for semantic search understanding
- Efficient query optimization for complex filter combinations
- Saved search system with real-time alert generation
- Search result ranking algorithm with multiple factors
- Performance optimization using caching and indexing strategies

## Dependencies
- Food post classification and tagging systems
- Search engine infrastructure with advanced indexing
- Natural language processing and semantic search capabilities
- User notification system for search alerts

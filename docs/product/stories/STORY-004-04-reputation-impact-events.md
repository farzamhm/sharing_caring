# Story 004.04: Reputation Impact Events

**Epic:** EPIC-004 - Global Reputation System
**Priority:** Critical
**Story Points:** 8
**Sprint:** TBD

## User Story
**As a** platform user  
**I want** my actions to appropriately affect my reputation  
**So that** good behavior is rewarded and poor behavior has consequences  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All platform actions trigger appropriate reputation events (positive and negative)
- [ ] Reputation events processed through Valkey streams for scalability
- [ ] Daily and weekly limits implemented to prevent gaming
- [ ] Event impact scores calculated based on context and user history
- [ ] Real-time reputation updates reflected across all platform features
- [ ] Event history maintained for transparency and appeals
- [ ] Automated anomaly detection for unusual reputation changes
- [ ] User notifications for significant reputation changes

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Event processing performance tested
- [ ] Anomaly detection algorithms validated
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Stream processing monitoring implemented

## Technical Notes
- Event-driven architecture using Valkey streams for reputation processing
- Configurable reputation event definitions with impact scores
- Rate limiting and daily caps to prevent manipulation
- Stream partitioning for user-based event ordering
- Dead letter queue for failed event processing
- Real-time reputation calculation with database consistency
- Event aggregation for performance optimization

## Dependencies
- Valkey streams infrastructure for event processing
- Reputation calculation engine
- All platform features that generate reputation events
- Anomaly detection system
- User notification system
- Database schema for reputation events and history

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Reputation gaming through coordinated actions
- **Mitigation**: Anomaly detection, rate limiting, and multi-factor validation
- **Risk**: Stream processing failures affecting reputation accuracy
- **Mitigation**: Dead letter queues, retry mechanisms, and monitoring alerts

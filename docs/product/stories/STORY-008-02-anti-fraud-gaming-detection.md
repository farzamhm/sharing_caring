# Story 008.02: Advanced Anti-Fraud & Gaming Detection

**Epic:** EPIC-008 - Security & Privacy Enhancements
**Priority:** High
**Story Points:** 8
**Sprint:** TBD

## User Story
**As a** platform administrator  
**I want** sophisticated systems to detect and prevent fraud and gaming attempts  
**So that** the community remains trustworthy and reputation systems maintain integrity  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-pattern fraud detection for reputation manipulation, credit abuse, spam behavior, safety violations
- [ ] Risk scoring system with configurable thresholds for different fraud types
- [ ] Automated response actions including flagging, restrictions, and escalation
- [ ] Machine learning integration for pattern recognition and anomaly detection
- [ ] Real-time fraud monitoring with immediate response capabilities
- [ ] False positive detection and alert tuning to minimize legitimate user impact
- [ ] Comprehensive audit trails for all fraud detection and response actions
- [ ] Integration with admin tools for manual review and investigation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Fraud detection algorithms tested and validated
- [ ] Machine learning models trained and deployed
- [ ] Automated response system verified
- [ ] False positive rates measured and optimized

## Technical Notes
- Advanced fraud detection engine with multiple pattern recognition algorithms
- Machine learning integration for adaptive fraud detection improvement
- Real-time monitoring system with configurable rules and thresholds
- Automated response system with graduated enforcement actions
- Comprehensive logging and audit trails for compliance and investigation
- Integration with admin tools for manual review and case management

## Dependencies
- Machine learning infrastructure and model training systems

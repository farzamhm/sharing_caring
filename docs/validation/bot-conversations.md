```
🤖 NeighborBot: Welcome to Neighborhood Sharing! 🏠✨

I help neighbors share homemade food and build community. Think of me as your friendly building coordinator who never sleeps!

Here's how it works:
• Share extra food with neighbors
• Discover amazing homemade meals nearby  
• Build trust through ratings and reviews
• Earn credits for sharing, spend them for receiving

Ready to join your neighborhood community?

[🚀 Get Started] [❓ Learn More] [📱 How It Works]

👤 Sarah: *clicks Get Started*

🤖 NeighborBot: Awesome! Let's get you set up, Sarah! 

To keep our community safe and local, I need to verify you're really a neighbor. Can you share your phone number for SMS verification?

Don't worry - your number stays private and is only used for verification and important safety notifications.

[📱 Share Phone Number] [🔒 Privacy Info] [❌ Maybe Later]

👤 Sarah: *clicks Share Phone Number and sends +1234567890*

🤖 NeighborBot: Perfect! I just sent a verification code to +123***7890

Please enter the 6-digit code (it might take up to 2 minutes to arrive):

👤 Sarah: 847392

🤖 NeighborBot: Great! Your phone is verified ✅

Now let's make sure you're really in the neighborhood. Can you share your current location so I can verify you're in or near our building?

This helps ensure only real neighbors can access our food sharing community.

[📍 Share Location] [🏠 Enter Address Manually] [❓ Why Location?]

👤 Sarah: *shares location*

🤖 NeighborBot: Perfect! You're verified as being at Oak Street Apartments! 🏢✅

Last step - let's set up your profile so neighbors know a bit about you:

What name would you like neighbors to see? (First name or nickname works great)

👤 Sarah: Sarah M

🤖 NeighborBot: Nice to meet you, Sarah M! 

What's your apartment number? This helps with pickup coordination and builds trust.

👤 Sarah: 4B

🤖 NeighborBot: Got it! Apartment 4B 📍

Do you have any dietary restrictions I should know about? This helps me show you relevant food options.

[🌱 Vegetarian] [🥛 Dairy-Free] [🌾 Gluten-Free] [🥜 Nut Allergy] [✅ No Restrictions] [➕ Other]

👤 Sarah: *selects Vegetarian*

🤖 NeighborBot: Welcome to the neighborhood, Sarah M! 🎉

You're all set up! Here's what you can do:

🍽️ /share - Share food with neighbors
🔍 /browse - See what's available  
💰 /credits - Check your balance (you start with 2 free credits!)

Want a quick tour of how sharing works?

[📚 Yes, show me!] [🚀 I'll figure it out] [🍽️ Start browsing food]

👤 Sarah: Yes, show me!

🤖 NeighborBot: Perfect! Let's do a quick walkthrough 🚶‍♀️

**Step 1: Sharing Food** 🍽️
When you cook extra, just type /share and I'll guide you through:
• Tell me what you made
• How many portions you have  
• Add a photo (food photos get 3x more requests!)
• When neighbors can pick up
• Any allergens to mention

**Step 2: Requesting Food** 🙋‍♀️  
When you're hungry or curious:
• Type /browse to see what's available
• Tap "Request" on anything interesting
• I'll connect you with the neighbor
• Coordinate pickup details

**Step 3: Credits & Community** ⭐
• Earn 1 credit for each meal you share
• Spend 1 credit for each meal you receive
• Rate experiences to build trust
• Help neighbors = build community!

### Scenario B: Cautious New User (Mike)

```
🤖 NeighborBot: Welcome to Neighborhood Sharing! 🏠✨

I help neighbors share homemade food and build community.

[🚀 Get Started] [❓ Learn More] [📱 How It Works]

👤 Mike: *clicks Learn More*

🤖 NeighborBot: Great question! Here's how Neighborhood Sharing works:

**🏠 Hyperlocal Community**
Only verified neighbors in your building can participate. I use phone and location verification to keep it safe and local.

**🍽️ Food Sharing Made Simple**  
• Neighbors post extra homemade food
• Others can request what looks good
• Meet briefly for pickup (usually at your door)
• Rate the experience to build trust

**💰 Credit System**
• Share food = earn credits
• Receive food = spend credits  
• New members get 2 starter credits
• No money changes hands - just community goodness!

**🛡️ Safety First**
• All neighbors are phone & location verified
• Rating system builds trust over time
• Easy reporting if issues arise
• Block or avoid problem users

Sound interesting? Questions before we get started?

[🚀 Sounds Good!] [🔒 What About Privacy?] [⚖️ Is This Legal?] [👥 Who Else Joined?]

👤 Mike: What about privacy?

🤖 NeighborBot: Excellent question! Privacy is super important 🔒

**What I Keep Private:**
• Your full phone number (neighbors only see "Mike L.")
• Your exact apartment (unless you share pickup details)
• Any personal info you don't explicitly share

**What Neighbors See:**
• Your first name + last initial ("Mike L.")
• General building verification (not exact unit)
• Food you're sharing (only when you post)
• Star ratings (anonymous)

**What You Control:**
• How much to share in your profile
• Whether to include apartment # in pickup details
• Block anyone you're uncomfortable with
• Delete your account anytime

You can start with minimal sharing and add more details as you get comfortable. Many people begin by just browsing what's available!

Feel better about privacy?

[👍 Yes, let's continue] [🔒 More privacy questions] [📖 Read full privacy policy]

👤 Mike: Yes, let's continue

🤖 NeighborBot: Awesome! Let's get you verified, Mike.

I'll need your phone number for SMS verification. This helps ensure only real neighbors join our community.

Your number is encrypted and never shown to other users - they'll only see "Mike L." when you interact.

[📱 Share Phone Number] [❓ Why phone needed?] [❌ Maybe later]

👤 Mike: Why phone needed?

🤖 NeighborBot: Great question! Here's why phone verification matters:

**🛡️ Safety & Trust**
• Prevents fake accounts and spam
• Creates accountability (one account per person)
• Enables important safety notifications
• Required for emergency contact if issues arise

**🏠 Local Community**  
• Combined with location, proves you're a real neighbor
• Helps building management verify residents if needed
• Prevents outsiders from accessing your building's community

**📞 How It's Used**
• One-time SMS verification (like banking apps)
• Critical safety alerts only (like "food recalled")
• Never shared with other users
• Never used for marketing or spam

Many apps require phone verification now - banking, rideshare, dating apps. We use the same secure systems they do.

Ready to verify?

[📱 OK, here's my number] [🔒 More security questions] [❌ Still not comfortable]

👤 Mike: *shares phone number +1555555123*

🤖 NeighborBot: Thanks! Sending verification code to +155***5123 now...

Please enter the 6-digit code when it arrives:

👤 Mike: 592841

🤖 NeighborBot: Perfect! Phone verified ✅

Now for location verification. I need to confirm you're actually in or near Oak Street Apartments.

This prevents people from other buildings or neighborhoods from accessing your local community.

[📍 Share Current Location] [🏠 Type Address] [❓ How accurate?]

👤 Mike: How accurate?

🤖 NeighborBot: Good question about location accuracy! 📍

**What I Check:**
• Are you within ~100 meters of the building?
• GPS can be off by 10-50 meters (that's normal!)
• If you're close but not exact, I may ask admin to verify

**What I Don't Track:**
• Your exact apartment number (unless you tell me)
• Your location after initial verification  
• Where you go or when you leave
• This is one-time verification, not ongoing tracking

**If Location Is Off:**
• Try stepping outside or near a window
• Manual address entry triggers quick admin review
• Building management can verify residents
• Usually resolved within a few hours

Ready to verify your location?

[📍 Share Location] [🏠 Manual Address] [🏢 Contact Building Manager]

👤 Mike: *shares location*

🤖 NeighborBot: Excellent! Location verified - you're confirmed at Oak Street Apartments! ✅

Let's finish your profile, Mike:

What would you like neighbors to call you?

👤 Mike: Just Mike is fine

🤖 NeighborBot: Perfect! And your apartment number? This helps with pickup coordination:

👤 Mike: 2A

🤖 NeighborBot: Got it! Any dietary restrictions?

[🌱 Vegetarian] [🥛 Dairy-Free] [🌾 Gluten-Free] [🥜 Nut Allergy] [✅ None] [➕ Custom]

👤 Mike: None

🤖 NeighborBot: Welcome to the neighborhood, Mike! 🎉

You're verified and ready to participate. You start with 2 free credits to try receiving food.

### Scenario B: Problem Resolution & Support

```
👤 Emma: I had an issue with my exchange yesterday

🤖 NeighborBot: Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that, Emma. I'm here to help resolve any issues 🤝

Can you tell me what happened? I'll do my best to make it right.

[📝 Describe the issue] [⚡ Emergency/safety concern] [❓ Just need advice]

👤 Emma: Describe the issue

🤖 NeighborBot: Please tell me what happened with your exchange. I'm listening and want to help:

👤 Emma: I shared my garden salad with Alex but he said it was "wilted and gross" when he picked it up. It was fresh when I made it! Now I'm worried about my rating.

🤖 NeighborBot: I understand how frustrating and hurtful that must be, Emma 😔

Food quality misunderstandings happen sometimes. Let me look into this right away.

**What I can see:**
• Your garden salad was posted yesterday at 3pm
• Alex picked it up around 6pm  
• Alex gave 2⭐ rating with comment "food was not fresh"
• This is unusual - you normally get 4.5+ star ratings

**Possible explanations:**
• Timing issue (salad sat for 3 hours)
• Different freshness expectations
• Miscommunication about pickup timing

How can I help make this right?

[🔍 Investigate further] [⭐ Request rating review] [💬 Mediate with Alex] [📚 Prevent future issues]

👤 Emma: Request rating review

🤖 NeighborBot: Absolutely. I can review ratings that seem unfair or inconsistent.

**For context:**
• Alex is newer (4 exchanges, 4.2⭐ average he gives others)
• You're established (31 exchanges, 4.9⭐ average you receive)
• Your salads historically get 4.5+ stars

**Questions to help:**
1. What time did you prepare the salad?
2. How was it stored before pickup?  
3. Did Alex mention anything during pickup?
4. Was pickup timing as planned?

👤 Emma: I made it around 2pm, kept it covered in the fridge, and Alex was actually 30 minutes late for pickup. He didn't say anything negative in person - seemed happy!

🤖 NeighborBot: That's very helpful context, Emma. This doesn't sound like a food quality issue on your end.

**My assessment:**
• You followed good food safety practices ✅
• Alex was late, not you ✅  
• Alex didn't express concerns during pickup ✅
• Rating is inconsistent with your history ✅

**Next steps:**
1. I'll reach out to Alex to understand his perspective
2. If needed, I can adjust/remove the unfair rating
3. I'll remind Alex about rating fairly and providing feedback during pickup

This shouldn't hurt your reputation. Your track record speaks for itself! 

[👍 Sounds good] [💬 I want to talk to Alex directly] [❓ How do ratings work?]

👤 Emma: Sounds good

🤖 NeighborBot: Perfect! I'll handle this tactfully and get back to you within 24 hours.

In the meantime, please don't let this discourage you from sharing! Your salads are beloved by the community - one questionable rating doesn't change that.

**Emma's Rating Summary:**
• Overall: 4.9⭐ from 31 exchanges
• Recent reviews: "Fresh and delicious!" "Best salads in the building!"  
• This outlier: Not representative of your quality

Keep being the amazing community member you are! 🥗✨

[📊 View my full rating history] [🥗 Share another salad] [❓ Community guidelines]

--- Next day ---

🤖 NeighborBot: Hi Emma! Update on your rating situation 📋

I spoke with Alex about the salad exchange. Here's what happened:

**Alex's perspective:**
• He was running late and stressed
• The salad was fine, but he was expecting a "restaurant-style" presentation  
• He didn't realize his rating was harsh until I explained the rating system
• He feels bad about the misunderstanding

**Resolution:**
✅ Alex updated his rating to 4⭐ with note: "Good salad, my expectations were unclear"
✅ Alex apologized and wants to request from you again
✅ I provided Alex with guidance on fair rating practices

Your overall rating is back to 4.9⭐! The community knows you make excellent food.

[💬 Message from Alex] [👍 Thanks for helping] [📚 Rating guidelines for others]

👤 Emma: Thanks for helping

🤖 NeighborBot: Of course! That's what I'm here for 🤝

Community issues like this are learning opportunities for everyone. Alex now understands rating etiquette better, and you can feel confident sharing again.

### Scenario B: Safety Issue Escalation

```
👤 Lisa: I need to report a safety concern

🤖 NeighborBot: ⚡ **PRIORITY RESPONSE** ⚡

I take safety very seriously. I'm here to help immediately.

**Type of safety concern:**
[🚨 Immediate danger] [😠 Harassment] [🏠 Unsafe behavior] [❓ Not sure] [📞 Emergency (call 911)]

👤 Lisa: Harassment

🤖 NeighborBot: I'm sorry you're experiencing harassment, Lisa. This is unacceptable and I will address it immediately.

**Your safety is my priority. Let's handle this step by step:**

1. Are you currently safe? [✅ Yes] [❌ No - need immediate help]

👤 Lisa: Yes

🤖 NeighborBot: Good. Now let's document what happened so I can take appropriate action.

**Details I need:**
• Who was involved?
• What happened?  
• When did this occur?
• Do you have any evidence (messages, photos)?

Please describe the harassment:

👤 Lisa: It was with Mark from 6B. When I went to pick up the pasta he shared, he made several inappropriate comments about my appearance and asked for my personal phone number. When I said no, he got pushy and stood too close to me. I felt very uncomfortable and unsafe.

🤖 NeighborBot: I am so sorry this happened to you, Lisa. This behavior is completely unacceptable and violates our community guidelines.

**Immediate actions I'm taking:**
1. ⚡ **Mark's account is temporarily suspended** (effective immediately)
2. 🔍 **Investigating his interaction history** with other neighbors  
3. 📋 **Creating official incident report** (ID: #SAF-2024-003)
4. 🛡️ **Blocking him from contacting you** in the app

**Next steps:**
• I will interview Mark about this incident
• I will check with other neighbors for similar experiences
• Depending on findings, permanent ban may be issued
• You will be updated within 24 hours

**Your options:**
[📞 Contact building management] [👮 File police report] [🛡️ Additional safety measures] [💬 Talk to counselor]

Do you want to add any additional details or evidence?

👤 Lisa: He also sent me a direct message through the bot after I left that said "Don't be such a prude, it was just a compliment"

🤖 NeighborBot: Thank you for that additional information. That message confirms inappropriate behavior and shows he doesn't understand consent or boundaries.

**Updated actions:**
✅ **Permanent ban** for Mark (effective immediately)  
✅ **Message evidence** saved to incident report
✅ **Pattern of harassment** documented
✅ **Building management notified** (they need to know about resident behavior)

**Mark has been permanently removed from the platform.**

Lisa, I want you to know:
• This was NOT your fault
• You handled the situation perfectly  
• Reporting this protects other neighbors
• The community supports you

**Follow-up:**
• Building manager will contact you within 24 hours
• I'll check in with you in 48 hours  
• If Mark attempts any contact outside the app, contact police immediately
• Your exchange credit has been refunded

How are you feeling? Do you need any additional support?

[👍 I'm okay] [😰 Still shaken] [💬 Want to talk] [🛡️ More safety info]

👤 Lisa: Still shaken

🤖 NeighborBot: That's completely understandable, Lisa. Harassment is traumatic and it's normal to feel shaken 💙

**Immediate support available:**
• Building has security cameras in hallways (management can review)
• Many neighbors want to support you (they're angry about Mark's behavior)  
• Professional counseling resources available if helpful
• Safety escort offers from other neighbors

**Mike L. (2A) sent a message:** *"This is completely unacceptable. Thank you for reporting it. You're protecting all of us. Let me know if I can help in any way."*

**Your courage in reporting this:**
✅ Protected other neighbors from harassment

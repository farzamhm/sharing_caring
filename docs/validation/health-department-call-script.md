## Sample Conversation Flow

**You:** "Hi, I'm calling about food sharing regulations. I want to organize neighbors sharing home-cooked meals. Can you help?"

**Health Dept:** "What kind of scale are we talking about?"

**You:** "About 10 neighbors in an apartment building, sharing meals 2-3 times per week. Just home-cooked food, no money changing hands."

**Health Dept:** "That sounds like private sharing between individuals. We don't regulate that."

**You:** "Great! Since I'm helping coordinate, does that change anything? Do I need any permits?"

**Health Dept:** "No, you're not selling food or running a business. As long as it's voluntary sharing, no permits needed."

**You:** "Perfect. Are there any guidelines or best practices you recommend?"

**Health Dept:** "Just basic food safety - keep hot foods hot, cold foods cold, don't share if you're sick."

**You:** "Thank you! Can I get your name and email in case questions come up?"

---

**Remember:** Be friendly, professional, and specific about what you're planning. Most health officials want to help ensure food safety, not shut down community initiatives.

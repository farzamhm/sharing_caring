# Story 008.05: Security Incident Response System

**Epic:** EPIC-008 - Security & Privacy Enhancements
**Priority:** High
**Story Points:** 7
**Sprint:** TBD

## User Story
**As a** platform administrator  
**I want** automated detection and response to security incidents  
**So that** threats are contained quickly and user impact is minimized  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated incident detection for data breaches, account takeovers, DDoS attacks, fraud rings
- [ ] Severity-based response automation with configurable actions and escalation
- [ ] Incident case management system with workflow tracking and documentation
- [ ] Real-time alerting and notification to security team and stakeholders
- [ ] Response action logging and audit trails for compliance and analysis
- [ ] Integration with external security tools and threat intelligence
- [ ] Post-incident analysis and reporting for continuous improvement
- [ ] Communication templates for user and stakeholder notifications

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Incident detection algorithms tested
- [ ] Automated response actions verified
- [ ] Incident management workflow implemented
- [ ] Security team training and runbook completion

## Technical Notes
- Automated security incident detection using pattern recognition and anomaly detection
- Incident response orchestration system with configurable automated actions
- Case management system for incident tracking, documentation, and workflow
- Real-time alerting and notification system for security incidents
- Integration with security information and event management (SIEM) systems
- Post-incident analysis and reporting capabilities for improvement

## Dependencies
- Security monitoring and detection infrastructure
- Automated response and mitigation systems
- Case management and workflow systems
- Alerting and notification infrastructure
- Security team training and procedures
- Integration with external security tools and threat intelligence

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Automated response actions causing unintended service disruption
- **Mitigation**: Careful response action design, testing, and human oversight capabilities
- **Risk**: Incident response system failures during critical security events
- **Mitigation**: Redundant systems, regular testing, and manual fallback procedures

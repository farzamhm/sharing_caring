# Story 001.04: Cross-Mode Compatibility

**Epic:** EPIC-001 - Dual-Mode Platform Foundation
**Priority:** High
**Story Points:** 4
**Sprint:** TBD

## User Story
**As a** platform user  
**I want** both modes to function independently without interference  
**So that** users can have consistent experiences regardless of mode choice  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Neighborhood and Community modes operate completely independently
- [ ] No data leakage between modes
- [ ] Shared platform features (reputation, credits) work in both modes
- [ ] Admin tools function appropriately for each mode
- [ ] System performance unaffected by dual-mode architecture
- [ ] Clear separation of mode-specific business logic
- [ ] Error handling works correctly for both modes

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] UX/UI reviewed and approved
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Security review completed (if applicable)

## Technical Notes
- Isolation testing to ensure no cross-mode interference
- Shared services (reputation, credits) mode-aware
- Event-driven architecture ensures proper separation
- Database design prevents mode confusion
- API endpoints appropriately scoped by mode

## Dependencies
- Reputation system updates for dual-mode support
- Credit system dual-mode integration
- Admin tools mode-awareness implementation
- Core platform services updates

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Unintended mode interactions
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive isolation testing and clear architectural boundaries
- **Risk**: Shared service confusion
- **Mitigation**: Mode-aware service design and thorough testing

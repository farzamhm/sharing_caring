# Deep Research Prompt: Neighborhood Sharing & Trust Platform

## Research Objective

**Primary Goal:** Validate core product hypotheses, understand target users deeply, and quantify market opportunity for the Neighborhood Sharing & Trust Platform before MVP development begins.

**Key Decisions This Research Will Inform:**
- MVP feature prioritization and development timeline
- Target neighborhood selection for pilot launch
- User acquisition strategy and messaging
- Business model validation (freemium conversion, token economics)
- Investment needs and funding strategy
- Risk mitigation priorities

**Success Criteria:**
- Clear go/no-go decision with 80%+ confidence
- Validated user personas with specific behavioral insights
- Quantified market opportunity with addressable market sizing
- Risk-ranked assumptions with mitigation strategies
- Actionable launch strategy with target metrics

## Background Context

**Product Concept:** A hyperlocal trust-based platform where verified neighbors trade home-cooked meals for services within expandable geographic circles, powered by blockchain reputation and accessible via Telegram bot + web/mobile apps.

**Key Innovation:** First platform to combine food + services + blockchain in hyperlocal context, starting with Telegram bot for zero-friction adoption.

**Target Launch:** 3-month MVP development, single building pilot, 50 active users goal.

**Core Assumptions to Validate:**
- Neighbors will share home-cooked food with location-verified strangers
- Service-for-food exchanges will create stronger engagement than pure food sharing
- Blockchain features will drive adoption rather than create friction
- Urban professionals and seniors will participate in same ecosystem
- Network effects kick in at 50 users per building/neighborhood

- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Limit enforcement testing completed
- [ ] Admin override functionality implemented
- [ ] Anomaly detection system integrated
- [ ] User communication and appeals process established

## Technical Notes
- Real-time spending limit calculation and enforcement during credit transactions
- Daily and weekly spending tracking per user with reputation-based thresholds
- Admin approval workflow for transactions exceeding limits for concerning users
- Integration with existing credit spending system for limit enforcement
- Anomaly detection for unusual spending patterns that may indicate abuse

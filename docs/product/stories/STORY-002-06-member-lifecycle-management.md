**Epic:** EPIC-002 - Community Group Management System
**Priority:** Medium
**Story Points:** 6
**Sprint:** TBD

## User Story
**As a** group admin  
**I want to** manage member access and behavior  
**So that** I can maintain group quality and handle issues  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automatic member detection when joining group
- [ ] Disclaimer requirement enforcement for new members
- [ ] Pseudonym generation upon disclaimer acceptance
- [ ] Access blocking for users who decline disclaimer
- [ ] Clean data removal when members leave group
- [ ] Member status tracking throughout lifecycle
- [ ] Admin notifications for lifecycle events
- [ ] Audit trail of all member actions

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] UX/UI reviewed and approved
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Security review completed (if applicable)

## Technical Notes
- Lifecycle Events:
  1. Member joins → disclaimer required
  2. Member accepts → pseudonym generated, access enabled
  3. Member declines → access blocked, can't use features
  4. Member removed → cleanup all associated data
- State tracking in `group_member_status` table
- Telegram webhook integration for member events
- Data cleanup procedures for departed members
- Activity logging in audit tables

## Dependencies
- Telegram webhook configuration
- Member status tracking system
- Data cleanup procedures
- Audit logging infrastructure

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Data retention compliance issues
- **Mitigation**: Clear data retention policies and automated cleanup
- **Risk**: Member status synchronization issues
- **Mitigation**: Event-driven updates and reconciliation processes

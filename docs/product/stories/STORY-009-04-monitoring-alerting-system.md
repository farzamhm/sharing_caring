# Story 009.04: Monitoring & Alerting System

**Epic:** EPIC-009 - Platform Scalability & Performance
**Priority:** Medium
**Story Points:** 6
**Sprint:** TBD

## User Story
**As a** platform administrator  
**I want** comprehensive monitoring and proactive alerting  
**So that** performance issues are detected and resolved before users are impacted  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive performance metrics collection (response time, throughput, error rate, database performance)
- [ ] Real-time monitoring dashboards with historical trend analysis
- [ ] Configurable alert thresholds with warning and critical severity levels
- [ ] Automated anomaly detection for unusual performance patterns
- [ ] Alert routing to appropriate team members based on severity and component
- [ ] Performance SLA monitoring with target achievement tracking
- [ ] System health scoring and overall platform health assessment
- [ ] Integration with incident response and escalation procedures

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards implemented and tested
- [ ] Alert configurations validated
- [ ] Anomaly detection algorithms tested
- [ ] SLA monitoring and reporting verified

## Technical Notes
- Comprehensive metrics collection using application performance monitoring (APM) tools
- Real-time dashboard with customizable views and drill-down capabilities
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection for performance patterns
- Alert aggregation and suppression to prevent notification fatigue
- Integration with ticketing and incident management systems
- Historical data retention and analysis for performance trend identification

## Dependencies
- Application performance monitoring (APM) infrastructure
- Time-series database for metrics storage and analysis
- Dashboard and visualization tools for real-time monitoring
- Alerting and notification systems
- Anomaly detection and machine learning infrastructure
- Incident management and response systems

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Monitoring system overhead affecting platform performance
- **Mitigation**: Efficient metrics collection, sampling strategies, and separate monitoring infrastructure
- **Risk**: Alert fatigue from excessive false positive notifications
- **Mitigation**: Smart alert aggregation, threshold tuning, and anomaly detection improvement

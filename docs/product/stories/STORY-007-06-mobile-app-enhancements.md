# Story 007.06: Mobile App Enhancements

**Epic:** EPIC-007 - Enhanced User Experience & Features
**Priority:** Medium
**Story Points:** 8
**Sprint:** TBD

## User Story
**As a** mobile user  
**I want** optimized mobile features and native app capabilities  
**So that** I can efficiently use the platform on-the-go  

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Location services integration for automatic distance calculation and nearby food alerts
- [ ] Native camera integration with photo editing tools for food posting
- [ ] Push notification system with rich notifications and action buttons
- [ ] Offline mode with cached food posts and queued actions for poor connectivity
- [ ] Quick actions with swipe gestures for common activities (claim, save, share)
- [ ] Mobile-optimized UI components with touch-friendly interactions
- [ ] Device-specific features (biometric authentication, haptic feedback)
- [ ] Performance optimization for mobile devices with efficient resource usage

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated

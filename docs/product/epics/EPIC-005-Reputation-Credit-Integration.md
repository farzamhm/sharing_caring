### Dynamic Credit Earning System
```python
class ReputationCreditService:
    """Integrates reputation system with credit mechanics."""
    
    CREDIT_MULTIPLIERS = {
        'exemplary': 1.5,    # 50% bonus
        'trusted': 1.25,     # 25% bonus
        'established': 1.0,   # Standard rate
        'developing': 1.0,    # Standard rate
        'concerning': 0.75    # 25% reduction
    }
    
    async def calculate_credit_reward(self, user_id: UUID, exchange_id: UUID) -> float:
        """Calculate credit reward based on reputation and exchange quality."""
        rep = await self.get_global_reputation(user_id)
        base_credit = 1.0
        
        # Reputation multiplier
        multiplier = self.CREDIT_MULTIPLIERS[rep.trust_level]
        
        # Quality bonuses
        exchange = await self.get_exchange(exchange_id)
        if exchange.recipient_rating >= 4.5:
            multiplier += 0.25  # High satisfaction bonus
        
        if exchange.food_post.category in ['homemade', 'organic']:
            multiplier += 0.15  # Premium food bonus
        
        # Community contribution bonus
        if rep.community_contributions > 50:
            multiplier += 0.1
        
        final_credits = base_credit * multiplier
        return round(final_credits, 2)
```

        rep.reputation_trend == 'rising' and
        rep.overall_score >= 60):
        
        recovery_amount = min(5, max(1, int(rep.overall_score / 20)))
        
        return {
            'eligible': True,
            'recovery_credits': recovery_amount,
